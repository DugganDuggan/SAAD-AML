## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)  

### **Title:** Methodology Selection  

---

### **1. Context and Problem Statement**  
The project required a development methodology that facilitated teamwork, adaptability, and iterative progress. The choice needed to support changing requirements and enable continuous feedback while keeping the team aligned with project goals.  

---

### **2. Considered Options**  
- **Scrum**  
- **Agile**  

---

### **3. Decision Outcome**  
- **Chosen Methodology:** Scrum  
- **Reasoning:** Scrum was chosen as it provides a structured framework within Agile principles. It introduces specific roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner), ceremonies (sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews), and artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog) that ensure clear accountability, regular progress reviews, and a focus on delivering value in short iterations.  

---

### **4. Consequences**  
- **Positive:**  
  - Clear structure and roles make responsibilities well-defined.  
  - Sprints enable incremental progress and frequent feedback, ensuring the product evolves with user needs.  
  - Regular meetings (stand-ups, sprint reviews) promote team communication and transparency.  
  - Retrospectives encourage continuous improvement after every sprint.  

- **Negative:**  
  - Requires consistent discipline and commitment from the team to adhere to Scrum practices.  
  - Frequent meetings can be time-intensive if not managed properly.  
  - Less flexibility compared to loosely following Agile principles without the Scrum framework.

### **5. Pros and Cons of the Options**  

**Scrum**  
Pros: Provides structure within Agile, ensures accountability, and encourages iterative progress and regular feedback.  
Cons: Requires strict adherence to ceremonies and roles, which can be challenging for small or inexperienced teams.  

**Agile**  
Pros: Flexible and adaptable, allows teams to choose and tailor practices as needed.  
Cons: Lacks the predefined structure of Scrum, which can lead to inconsistency or lack of discipline in team processes.
